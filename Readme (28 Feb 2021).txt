This version of the tool is the one released on 28 Feb 2021


The template files need to be stored in the "\LabVIEW Data\PopupMenus\edit time panel and diagram\Templates" user folder.

Example full path: "C:\Users\Petru\Documents\LabVIEW Data\PopupMenus\edit time panel and diagram\Templates".

The "Templates" path needs to be created by the user.

There are two types of files accepted as templates at the moment: ".vi" and ".ctl"
